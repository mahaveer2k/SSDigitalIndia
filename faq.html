                            Well, since you&#39;re here, we suggest you use our get a quote form. Otherwise, the best way to ensure
                            that we get all the information necessary to accurately estimate is to give us a call and talk with one
                            of our customer service representatives.

                            <strong>At what resolution should I save my photos and graphics?</strong><br>
                            Resolution should be set to 300 dpi.
                            
                            Pictures and graphics pulled from the internet are often low resolution, typically 72 dpi or 96 dpi.
                            Avoid these graphics, as they will appear pixilated and blocky when printed.
                            Also note that you should save all photos in CMYK mode, not RGB mode, when possible. Images
                            saved in RGB mode may not print properly. If you are unable to save your image in CYMK mode,
                            please let us know.

                            In printing terms, a proof is a one-off copy of your document after all modifications and printing
                            setup processes have been completed. It is your last and best opportunity to make sure that the print
                            job comes out the way you want. By carefully inspecting the proof, you can help us assure an
                            accurate, flawless delivery of your print job on the first run.

                            <strong>Why do the printed colors look different from the colors on my screen?</strong><br>
                            In short, printers and monitors produce colors in different ways.
                            Monitors use the RGB (red, green, blue) color model, which usually supports a wider spectrum of
                            colors. Printers use the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) color model, which can reproduce
                            most—but not all—of the colors in the RGB color model. Depending on the equipment used, CMYK
                            generally matches 85–90% of the colors in the RGB model.
                            When a color is selected from the RGB model that is out of the range of the CMYK model, the
                            application chooses what it thinks is the closest color that will match. Programs like Adobe
                            Photoshop will allow you to choose which color will be replaced. Others may not.

                            <strong>What file format should I use when submitting my electronic document for printing?</strong><br>
                            PDF (Portable Document Format) is the most common and preferred file format for submitting digital
                            documents. With the installation of a PDF print driver on your computer, virtually any program can
                            generate a PDF file suitable for printing. Both commercial and free PDF print drivers are available
                            online for download from different sources.

                            <strong>Once I submit the documents, how long will it take to finish my job?</strong><br>
                            Simple jobs are often completed in less than an hour. Some jobs, however, may take several days to
                            complete depending on their complexity and size. We always strive to provide an accurate estimate
                            of the turnaround time for each job we do. And we’ll always work with you to find ways to complete
                            your project when you need it.

                            <strong>What is variable data printing?</strong><br>
                            Variable data printing is technology for printing documents so that each piece is personalized to the
                            specific recipient. At the most basic level, this means personalizing a name and address. But for real
                            impact, many projects include unique graphics and content that speaks directly to the recipient.

                            <strong>What does personalization mean?</strong><br>
                            Personalization is another term for variable data—technology for printing documents so that each
                            piece is personalized to the specific recipient.
                            Personalizing can be as simple as a unique name and address on every printed piece. But more
                            sophisticated levels of personalization can include text or images that vary based on data specific to
                            the recipient, or data-driven graphics such as a pie chart illustrating something specific to the
                            recipient.
